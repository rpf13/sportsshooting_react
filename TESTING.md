## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I have tested the `DeleteModal`, the `NavBar` and the `NotFound` component via jest unit test.

- [DeleteModal Unit Test](src/components/__tests__/DeleteModal.test.js)
- [NavBar Unit Test](src/components/__tests__/NavBar.test.js)
- [NotFound](src/components/__tests__/NotFound.test.js)

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive. However, I wanted to include a few example tests to showcase the use of jest in a React app. It turned out to be quite difficult, if more complex components containing lots of states, are tested.

### JEST Unit Testing

I have used [jest](https://jestjs.io) for the java script unit testing. In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`npm test`

All testcases have been successfully executed:

The following table shows a summary of testcases executed. The the `DeleteModal`, the `NavBar` and the `NotFound` component got tested via the automated unit testing.
