## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I have tested the `DeleteModal`, the `NavBar` and the `NotFound` component via jest unit test.

- [DeleteModal Unit Test](src/components/__tests__/DeleteModal.test.js)
- [NavBar Unit Test](src/components/__tests__/NavBar.test.js)
- [NotFound](src/components/__tests__/NotFound.test.js)

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive. However, I wanted to include a few example tests to showcase the use of jest in a React app. It turned out to be quite difficult, if more complex components containing lots of states, are tested.

### JEST Unit Testing

I have used [jest](https://jestjs.io) for the java script unit testing. In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`npm test`

All testcases have been successfully executed and passed:

![jest testresults](docs/testing/jest_testcases.png)

The following table shows a summary of testcases executed. The the `DeleteModal`, the `NavBar` and the `NotFound` component got tested via the automated unit testing.

| Class | Function | Description | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DeleteModal.js |  |  |  |
|  | renders DeleteModal with correct content | The modal displays the title "Confirm Deletion", show a text "Are you sure you want to delete this item?" and have two buttons: "Cancel" and "Delete" |  |
|  | calls the handleClose function when Cancel button is clicked | the mock function `handleClose` is called | `jest.fn()` mock function is created for the `handleClose` |
|  | calls the handleConfirm function when Delete button is clicked | the mock function `handleConfirm` is called | mock setup initially done |
| NavBar.js |  |  |  |
|  | renders NavBar | link with the name "SignIn" is present in the document |  |
|  | renders link to the user profile for a logged in user | the profile avatar is in the document together with a link named "apple" pointing to /profiles/1 | "apple" is the testuser |
|  | renders sign in and sign up buttons again on log out and check all available links | the "SignIn & SignUp" link is present in the document. "Add match & Add gun" is **not** present|  |
|  | renders logged-in navigation items when user is authenticated | links for authenticated user "Add match & Add gun & MySchedule & MyGuns & signOut" are all present |  |
| NotFound.js |  |  |  |
|  | renders NotFound component with correct message | image in form of "img" is present with error message "Sorry, the page you're looking for doesn't exist"  |  |

## Manual Testing

###Â User Story Testing

I have tested the functional user stories and listed in the following table, together with a screenshot. Since I did also add user stories for admin tasks like documentation, app submission, I did not include them in the table - since snapshots are difficult for those. However, they are also clearly documented in the README section.
In the user stories, I did use the expression "As a Developer..." but this can be interchangeably used with "As a User..."
User Story testing has been executed with Chrome browser on OSX.

### Defensive Programming

The following section will show a table, where I have tested the app, whith Chrome browser, for various cases and error cases. It should test if the application behaves as intended and gives a great user experience. It is worth to mention, that I'm pretty sure *someone* can break the application, but the main intention of this project was not to create a bullet proof app, it should be about learning React and DRF API. However, *great care has been taken* to catch as many potential errors as possible.

Please note that this section is not the only section, where the application has been tested. Throughout the whole testing procedure, I did choose many different use cases in order to check the behaviour. So this means also the responsive testing or the browser compatibility testing have indirectly checked the functionality.
This gave me confidence, that the application works also with different browsers and resolutions.

In the **first part**, tests are done with **an unauthenticated user**, which as such, has (intentionally) access to many parts of the site:

## Code Validation

### W3C CSS Validation

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate my CSS files.
There were no critical errors. Since the `:global` is valid code, used with such a css.module based application and W3C validation not understanding it, it shows an error. However, searching the web, the official [CSS Module Documentation](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules#composing-from-global-class-names) says that it is valid.

<details>
<summary>W3C CSS Validation with snapshots</summary>

### ESLint Validation

All JavaScript code was validated using the integrated ESLint JavaScript validator. This validation was a big help during development, since it pointet clearly out if there was misused import, unused variables or missing semi colons or incorrect formating.
After finishing my project, no more errors were shown on the console.

### Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.
I have tested it on Chrome, Safari and Firefox on OSX. I did not test with Edge Browser, since it is also based on Chromium, I would expect the same result as for Chrome browser.

In the table below you can find snapshots of each browser. I did a "walkthrough" of the most important features / workflow, which a user would execute. Note that I did also test some *error cases*, since I've tried to combine the browser compatibility testing with defensive programming testing.

### Responsiveness

I have tested the application on various devices in terms of responsiveness. I could not find any blocking issue. Furthermore, I did take great care and have added some media queries, just for the small screens, because I did not like some of the components, when they were small.
I have to say, all in all, it looks good also on small devices. However, on very small screens, some part could be "more beautiful", but in my opition, this would require to redesign the app or enhance massively. 
I think, the current state is quite good in terms of responsiveness.

Below a table, where I did chooce a set of *testcases* to be run on each device. It includes a variety of mobile devices, starts with the iPhone SE, which is a *medium* screen, over the iPhone 12 Pro, which has a *larger* screen. To verify the app on a very small screen, I have chosen the Samsung Galaxy Fold.
In order to test the tablet category, the iPad Air has been used.

### Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. There were now major issues found. The preformance report for the mobile version is rather low, but lighthouse stated, that there are performance issues due to some plugins I have active. Well, I have quite many active, trying to toggle some of the did not help. However, without theses "strange" plugins of mine, it should be better.
The minor issue with the contrast was already described in the *Color Scheme* part of the README.

## Bugs

### GitHub **Issues**

I did use GitHub Issues to track all my work, as already explained in the Agile Development section of the README. Below a snapshot with an excerpt:
![Github Issues](docs/images/github_issues.png)
The intention was to also track the bugs with github issus via adding a `bug`, opening them as stories and add them to the kanban board.
Since I did start from the beginning to deploy my project to Heroku, I did continuously verify the state of the application. Furthermore, each feature was locally tested, before / just after commit. Therefore I could fix most of the issues during the development phase. I did not open bugs when discovering an issue while being still on the development face of that particular feature.

**Fixed Bugs**

As previously mentioned, I did only start "counting" bugs when doing the testing of the front and back end application, hence the development process was finished. Since I did heavy testing during development, I could find potential issues already then. Therefore the list with bugs, found during the finalt testing round, is empty.

| Bug | Status |
| --- | --- |
| [Profile Social Media URL Error](https://github.com/rpf13/sportsshooting_react/issues/44) | resolved |
| [Gun Create form image validation error missing](https://github.com/rpf13/sportsshooting_react/issues/45) | resolved |
| [Controll ID on Forms](https://github.com/rpf13/sportsshooting_react/issues/47) | resolved |
| [Potential Memory Leak with PopularMatches Component](https://github.com/rpf13/sportsshooting_react/issues/48) | resolved |

**Open Issues**

When writing / submitting my project for assessment, there were no open issues, bugs I am aware of. However, the epic with the stretch items / future features is still in the open state. Such epics, stories got the `WontHave` tag during MoSCoW priorisation. 
Any remaining open issues can be tracked [here](https://github.com/rpf13/sportsshooting_react/issues).

## Unfixed Bugs

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
